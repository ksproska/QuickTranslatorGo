00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.083
As you know, I'm on the
pill, so here is your copy

00:00:02.083 --> 00:00:04.048
of the prophylactic waiver.

00:00:04.048 --> 00:00:05.590
Well, looks like we
have a deal here.

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:06.510
I'm looking forward
to consummation.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:06.930
Excellent.

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:07.470
Thank you.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.350
This is Donna
Pinciotti, and this

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.180
is how Donna ended
up during That

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.770
'70s Show's abysmal
final season.

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:15.630
Hi, honey.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.200
Thank you for the
postcard with the monkeys.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.360
I'm still bananas about you too.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.950
Over the course of
the eight seasons

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.960
that the show
dominated airwaves,

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.880
Donna was developed
into one of the most

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.430
interesting and endearing
characters on TV

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.400
and then completely
kneecapped during the show's

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.360
legacy-tarnishing slalom
towards its ultimate conclusion.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.470
Before we get too deep
into today's episode,

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.580
please like and subscribe to
Nerdstalgic for more videos

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:42.570
just like this one.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.820
Laura Prepon's Donna
Pinciotti might not

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.160
be the first character you
think of when you picture

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.540
the cast of That '70s Show.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.580
But on a closer
look, she really is

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.053
one of the breakout characters.

00:00:52.053 --> 00:00:53.970
Well hey Eric, don't you
want your balls back?

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:54.900
OK, now look.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.840
That's a little uncalled for.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.800
Oh, yeah.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.910
Thanks.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.710
Culturally, she was
just overshadowed

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.540
by Fez's cartoonish accent.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.170
Michael, rub oil on my
thighs while I spank you.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.960
Or Kelso's idiotic
comedic sensibilities.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.300
You got a permanent.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.370
So that's permanent?

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.160
In fact, most of the
characters on That '70s Show

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.280
had clearly defined narrative
real estate that they lived in.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.890
But Donna was a bit
more loosely defined

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.870
early on in the
show, which gave her

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.490
more room to grow and change.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.500
Donna was literally
and figuratively

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.600
the girl next door in the show,
but she was also so much more

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.100
than that.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.650
She was a complicated person
with a distinct background

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.660
viewpoint and wry
sense of humor.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:37.650
Oh, believe me, Donna.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.440
I'd love to go, but
Red said I can't, and--

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.320
well, he can kick my ass, so--

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.570
Eric, I can kick your ass.

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.240
We also got to witness
Topher Grace's Eric Forman

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.060
grow and mature through his
relationship with Donna.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.750
They complemented each other and
yet were also polar opposites.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.000
That was the joy of the
early seasons of the show,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.280
seeing these two
seemingly unlikely lovers

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.080
bounce off of each
other and learn

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.430
and grow from their mistakes.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.680
This dynamic, and all
of its complexities,

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.230
are laid out in the
show's inaugural episode,

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.050
the climax of which is Donna
and Eric Forman sitting

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.090
on the hood of a
flashy Vista Cruiser

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.850
that Eric's father explicitly
told him not to take out

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.060
of town, and yet, thanks to
Donna's encouragement, Eric

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.390
and the gang use the car to
attend a Todd Rundgren concert.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.510
Coming down off the high of
this youthful rebellion, Donna

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.180
and Eric bond, simmering
with romantic tension.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.270
In some ways, Donna is presented
as the manic pixie dream girl

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.570
trope, but Prepon's performance
is so self-assured and nimbly

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.700
humorous that the rote
elements of her roll's

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.040
initial characterization
pale in comparison

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.450
to the magic on the screen.

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.920
The pilot climaxes with the
quintessential high school

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:42.420
moment--

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.580
Eric Forman not
seizing the opportunity

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.840
and going in for the kiss.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.190
So what does Donna do?

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.900
She chooses to take
the initiative,

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.050
sealing their burgeoning romance
with a single good night kiss.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.460
What was that for?

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.920
I just wanted to see
what it was like.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.684
What was it like?

00:02:58.684 --> 00:02:59.930
You were there.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.030
Under normal sitcom
narrative construction,

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.280
this would have happened
dozens of episodes

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.590
and countless seasons
into the run of a show.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.660
The Office took four seasons
to finally get Jim and Pam

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:10.160
together.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.960
For New Girl, it
took six seasons

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.030
to finally seal the
deal with Nick and Jess.

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.420
A normal sitcom wants to
build an emotional investment

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.400
in the two leads'
emotional dynamic

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.620
prior to eventually
getting them together.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.930
This is the pilot
of That '70s Show.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.910
We understand from
the jump that Donna

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.040
isn't going to be your
average love interest.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.440
She's going to be an
equal partner in the show

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.430
as it develops.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.220
And over the first season,
we see countless examples

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.470
of Donna's complexities
and intricately

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.080
woven emotional life
written across the series.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.300
Like in episode seven of
the first season where

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.120
Donna chooses to sing and
dance the night away with Eric,

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.160
recreating the ABBA
music they just

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.310
witnessed together as a means
of helping them both evolve.

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.190
Donna and Eric quickly become
the central narrative nucleus

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.600
that the show revolves around.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.970
They are the emotional
heart of the program.

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.370
The show does a masterful
job of illustrating

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.300
why someone in Donna's position
needs, enjoys, and loves

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:03.650
someone like Eric Forman.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.440
It all stems back to her
relationship with her parents--

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.460
Bob and Midge.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:11.030
Midge is a free spirit, and
Bob is more of a loud out there

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.750
ladies man.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.550
Midge ends up
leaving Bob since she

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.350
was unhappy with
being a housewife,

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.079
and Bob subscribed to more
of the man of the house

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:19.310
sensibilities of the time.

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.030
When Donna sees in Eric is the
exact opposite, a progressive

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.700
with a non-threatening physique
and an intricate knowledge

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.140
of Star Wars, and this
is charming to her.

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.620
Donna goes through five
seasons of characterization.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.260
She has ups and downs,
break ups with Eric,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.290
starts dating Luke Wilson's
Casey Kelso in season four--

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:37.640
Come here little guy.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:38.450
OK.

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:39.080
All right.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.650
OK.

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.890
All right.

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:40.730
Good to see you.

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:41.510
OK.

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.660
OK!

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:41.950
All right!

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:42.450
OK.

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:43.250
OK.

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.100
Then in season five gets
back together with Eric

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.920
and we see how much they've
matured but are stronger

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:49.430
together.

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.500
Despite the fact that
Donna is in control

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.570
for much of her
relationship with Eric,

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.750
the later seasons seem to lose
the thread with her character.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.580
In season five,
they get engaged.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.490
However, Eric stands Donna
up on the wedding day only

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.230
to return saying he was scared.

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:06.525
All I knew was that I--

00:05:06.525 --> 00:05:09.020
Donna, I think we were about
to make a huge mistake.

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.270
I'm sure there's a good
version of this storyline that

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.400
painted Donna in an
empowering light,

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.620
but it just feels
weird and wrong

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.200
that the show is doing
all of this to her

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.290
and that she's not the person
dictating how things turn out.

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:24.320
Because that's been basically
her role the entire show.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.410
This goes all the way back to
the pilot when she's the one

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.450
to initiate that first kiss.

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.060
During season seven, Topher
Grace and Ashton Kutcher

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.620
were negotiating
to leave the show

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.410
to pursue other opportunities,
and by the time season

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.990
eight rolled around, the
narrative runway was already

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:40.310
out from underneath the show.

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.680
Because Topher Grace
wasn't going to be there,

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.050
Eric Forman had decided
to take a gap year

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.480
and move to Africa,
leaving Donna in the lurch

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.240
despite the fact that she had
deferred her college choices

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.440
in order to be with him.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.040
Kelso is also only in five
episodes of the final season.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.300
It's just a train wreck.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.520
The idea of Eric hurting
Donna in this way

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.220
is counter to both of the
establishing characters.

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.430
Him doing it violates the exact
reasons why she loves him.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.040
Therefore, in later
episodes where he returns,

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.510
she would never take him back.

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:11.000
It's very apparent from the
beginning of season eight

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.880
that the showrunners did not
know what to do with Donna.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.680
They were trapped
into only viewing her

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.200
through the Eric-shaped
box they had put her in.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.450
After initially trying
to introduce a new Eric

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:23.180
stand in named Charlie, they
wrote him out of the show.

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.760
Therefore Josh Myers was
cast as Randy Pearson.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.950
The showrunners decided
to introduce Randy

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.230
as equal parts Eric and Kelso.

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:32.610
He could fill the narrative
shoes of both of them

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:35.210
but also be presented as
a potential love interest

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:38.150
to Donna, which is as
horrible as it sounds.

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.000
Randy's whole thing is that
everyone thinks he's perfect.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.110
Even Red likes him.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.152
They taught me how to play
their games of chance.

00:06:44.152 --> 00:06:46.277
Donna, must be nice to
finally have a boyfriend who

00:06:46.277 --> 00:06:48.770
can swing that sledgehammer
and hit that little black thing

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:50.370
past-- seriously hit it.

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:53.313
And so that has to mean
that Donna would immediately

00:06:53.313 --> 00:06:54.230
fall in love with him.

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.730
Right?

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:57.260
It's not like there's seven
previous seasons where

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:58.940
we learn that Donna
doesn't want to be

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.490
with an over the top
ladies man like her father.

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.700
Season eight just nerfs all of
Donna's character development.

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:07.280
Even early on in the season
when Eric is in Africa

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.620
and he's regularly calling
his mother on the telephone,

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:10.820
he never calls Donna.

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.440
So I asked Mrs.
Foreman is he OK,

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.110
and she said yeah, because
he called her last night.

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:17.780
She even stays up through the
night in one episode waiting

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:19.460
for him to call, even
though he doesn't.

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.560
In a season filled
with terrible ideas

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.490
like Jackie and Fez
should get together

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:25.310
and what if Hyde
marries a stripper,

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:29.510
the way Donna is treated is
both the most subtly horrible

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:33.180
and the most frustrating.

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.860
He had to run the class.

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:37.620
So I'm going to go grab a beer.

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:40.200
Following closely behind
the incomprehensible Donna

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.990
and Randy romance storyline
for strangest subplot

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:45.360
involving Donna ever is
the running narrative

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.190
all throughout the
final season that

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:50.370
sees Kitty and Donna become
estranged due to some mutually

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:51.420
misplaced anger.

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:54.030
This doesn't seem like anything
that would ever happen.

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:56.430
Donna might as well be Kitty's
daughter at this point,

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:59.520
and the whole season still
takes place in their basement.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.350
Having Kitty and
Donna be estranged

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:04.110
but then having her in
the basement every episode

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:05.610
feels forced and wrong.

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:08.640
And to top it all off, their
big reconciliation in the finale

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:11.550
just feels completely
hollow and unearned.

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:13.770
Like everything in
season eight, it just

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:16.380
happens because it
apparently needs to happen.

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:18.150
By the final episode
of the season,

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:21.210
when Eric finally returns and
he and Donna get back together,

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:22.500
it's too little too late.

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:25.350
The show has just belly flopped,
dragged Donna through the mud,

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:28.020
and completely ruined the
beautifully unique character

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:30.210
that it spent all of
that time developing.

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:32.130
It's really a shame
how That '70s Show

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:35.010
took one of the best and most
tightly plotted characters

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:37.860
and then just said what
if she dated Randy.

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:39.820
Well, that's all we have today.

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:41.669
